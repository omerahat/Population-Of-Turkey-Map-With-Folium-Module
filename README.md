## Population-Colored Map of Turkish Provinces
This repository contains a script to create a population-colored map of the provinces in Turkey using Python and the folium and pandas libraries. The map is generated by fetching data from a JSON file containing information about the provinces and their populations, and visualizing the data on a map using the folium library.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need to have the following software installed on your computer:

#####Python 

#####Folium

#####Pandas

You can install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install folium pandas
```
##Running the Script
To run the script, simply execute the following command in your terminal:
```
python population_map.py
```
The script will generate an HTML file named population_map.html that you can open in a web browser to view the population-colored map of the Turkish provinces.

##Customizing the Map
You can customize the appearance of the map by modifying the parameters in the folium.Map() function and the code that generates the choropleth layer. Please refer to the folium documentation for more information.

##Data Source
The data used in this script was obtained from an external source. If you use this script, please be sure to cite the data source in your project
